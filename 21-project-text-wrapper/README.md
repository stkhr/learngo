# Text Wrapper Challenge Guideline

In this project your goal is to mimic the soft text wrapping feature of text editors. For example, when there are 100 characters on a line and if the soft-wrapping is set to 40, the editors cut each line that goes beyond 40 characters and display the rest of the line in the next line instead.

## EXAMPLE

Wrap the text for 40 characters in a line. For example, for the following input, the program should print the following output.

**INPUT:**
Hello world, how is it going? It is ok. The weather is beautiful.

**OUTPUT:**
Hello world, how is it going? It is ok.
The weather is beautiful.

## RULES

* The program should also work with Unicode text. You can find a unicode story in [story.txt](story.txt) file in the current folder. Please use the text in the file and soft-wrap it to 40 characters.
