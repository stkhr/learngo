# Struct Exercises

You'll build a queryable command-line game store.

1. **[Warm Up](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/24-structs/exercises/01-warmup)**

    Load up the data into the game store.

2. **[List](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/24-structs/exercises/02-list)**

    Now, it's time to add an interface to your program using the bufio.Scanner. So the users can list the games, or search for the games by id.

3. **[Query By Id](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/24-structs/exercises/03-query-by-id)**

    Add a new command: "id". So the users can query the games by id.
